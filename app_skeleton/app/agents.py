"""Stage: the planner and the reviewer. Replaced in week 5.

Week 5 builds a planner, a free plan validator, and a reviewer on Pydantic
AI, against a toy repository. The pattern transfers to this application and
the repository does not, so this is one of the two stages you write rather
than copy. Keep the shapes week 5 taught you, minus `suspect_file`, which
named a file in the toy repository:

    Plan(goal: str, steps: list[str])      flat, because nested fails
    validate_plan(plan) -> tuple[bool, list[str]]
    Verdict(decision: "approve" | "reject", reason: str)

and provide the two functions `pipeline.py` calls, plus the name of the
model your agents use, so the trace records it:

    make_plan(question: str) -> Plan
    review(question: str, answer: str, evidence: list[str]) -> Verdict | None
    MODEL_NAME: str                         for example LARGE.name

Your `validate_plan` checks steps against the tools the agent actually has
(`tools.REGISTRY`) instead of week 5's KNOWN_FILES. Your reviewer sees the
answer and the evidence and not the agent's reasoning, for the reason week 5
gave: a reviewer that inherits the reasoning inherits the mistake.

`review` returning None means "not reviewed". The stub returns None rather
than an approval, because a stub that approves everything would be a stub
claiming to have checked something.

If week 5 measured that the plain loop wins, keep all three pass-throughs
and delete all three `@stub` lines below, and say so in DECISIONS.md. A
pass-through you chose is a design. One you skipped is a stub.
